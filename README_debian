Building Installable Debian Packages
====================================

Before building make sure you have Android NDK installed and
"ndk-build" in the PATH.

$ debgen -v somc-sampler
or if you do not have debgen in your PATH, it is in the mib-tools git:
$ <PATH-TO-MIB-TOOLS-GIT>/debgen/debgen -v somc-sampler

somc-sampler is a subdirectory containing scripts and configuration for creating the
package.

A successful build would generate a file like:
somc-sampler_1.0.20130723.1+git20130723.7c3857bd_all.deb

IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============
To ensure proper traceability the following things must be considered before building
the final package to be distributed:
- all changes must be committed and published (merged and uploaded)
- the working directory from which the package is built must be clean
