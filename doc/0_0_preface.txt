sampler
=======

Produces periodic samples gathered from files any target system. Typical
files would be files from sysfs, procfs, devfs but also normal files like
log-files.

Samples are either periodical, where period-time is defined in uS by -t flag
at start-up, or event-driven. Event driven samples are defined by a rule
describing the trigger (TBD).

A sample is defined as a series of signals. Each signal is defined by one
line in a file describing all signals. Output format for each sample is on
clear-text line where each signal is has it's private column representing
the same order it was mentioned in the descriptive file, prepended by 3
special signals: "sample id", "kernel timestamps (i.e. time-stamp since
start-up) and "sample time" (i.e. time it took to complete a sample). The
latter is needed to determine jitter due to system load or I/O-wait of any
data source.

Full format of the output (assuming delimiter is ";") would be:

{sample id};{kernel time};{sample time};{signal_0};..{signal_n}

Field details are described below.
