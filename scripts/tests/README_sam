First make sure adb is working and we have connection with device:

$ adb devices


Start sampler-plot in live mode:

$ sam plot-live base_util.spc


Check device for running sampler processes:

$ sam status


Start sampler (default rate is 50Hz) on device in background, its ok to detach usb cable:

$ sam start base_util.spc


Stop running sampler and extract sampler log:

$ sam stop

It's also possible to set rate, start sampler on device in background
with sampling rate 100Hz, its ok to detach usb cable:

$ sam start -r 100 base_util.spc


Start sampler-plot in file mode, gnuplot view:

$ sam plot-file base_util.spc ~/sampler/sampler_20140924_114124


Start sampler-plot in file mode, csv output:

$ sam plot-file --csv a.csv base_util.spc ~/sampler/sampler_20140924_114124


Edit spc file:

$ sampler-editor ~/sampler/base_util.spc
